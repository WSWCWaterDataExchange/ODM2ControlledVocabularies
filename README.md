# WaDE Controlled Vocabularies

The source code for a Python/Django web application and REST API for managing the Water Data Exchange program (WaDE) Controlled Vocabularies. WaDE is part of the Western States Water Council programs.
 

The deployed online moderated registry at http://vocabulary.westernstateswater.org/ aims to promote consistent use of terminology (i.e., Controlled Vocabularies) to describe attributes of the Water Data Exchange(WaDE) project across the seventeen Western US States while they still retain the use of their native terms. The use of these controlled vocabularies allow interoperable data query across states and regional analysis. Click at the tables below to view their vocabularies. You may suggest edits to the existing vocabularies or suggest new ones to be added. Scroll to the bottom for more info on how to the registry works.

### Credit 
The design of this registry is adapted from the source code of the ODM2 ControlledVocabularies available on GitHub @ github.com/ODM2/ODM2ControlledVocabularies. Thanks to Dr. Jeff Horsburgh and the ODM2 team for promoting #OpenScience by publishing their source code.


The adapted source code is available on GitHub @ https://github.com/WSWCWaterDataExchange/WaDEControlledVocabulary and includes detailed instructions on the changes made to the original repository and how to deploy, access, and populate the repository. The configuration and deployment of the original repository have been significantly changed to be much simplified and automated using Ansible and Docker.
